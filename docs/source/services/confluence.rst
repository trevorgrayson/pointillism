Confluence (Atlassian)
======================

Rendering pointillism resources on \
`Confluence <https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence>`_ \
is supported.

Unfortunately, Confluence made some large updates and broke a 
lot of functionalty, or at least made it hard to get to.

This ridiculous process is the most straight forward way for you 
to render graphs in confluence.

Confluence Workaround
---------------------

You'll be copy/pasting in a Markdown image into confluence.

1. Take your pointillism url and make it into a markdown image::

   ![pointillism image](https://pointillism.io/trevorgrayson/pointillism/example.dot.svg)``

2. You need to remove rich text formatting from it. \
If you have a basic browser, you may get to skip the next step.
3. Paste your image text into a non rich-text text area (your browser's URL bar will work.)
4. Copy the text out again.
5. Paste this into Confluence where you would like it.
